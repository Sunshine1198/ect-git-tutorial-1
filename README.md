  
According to all known laws
of aviation,
  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
  
The bee, of course, flies anyway
 
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

Once again I am asking you to be my human wife as a bee....

Ya like jazz?
